Proposals
=========

The app Proposals contains all proposals. Staff can create these proposals (projects that students can execute) during
the first phases of the marketplace. Then track heads check them and students can apply for any of them. Finally
proposals are distributed among students and they can start.
Proposals can have files attached. These can be attachements (pdf files usually) or images. Images show as image slider
 on the top of the detailview, while attachements become download buttons at the bottom of the details page.
